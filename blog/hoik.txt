Hoik. It sounds like a really weird word.
I agree.

A hoik is a certain placement of tiles in the game Terraria that glitches
the game's slope system and causes the player to zoom along the screen.

They are cool. Also somewhat useful if you want to cheese some of the bosses.
It was originally a bug but was later made into a feature.
